The Libelium Smart Parking sensor enables detection of available parking spots 
in smart cities. The sensor has already been implemented by anypayload and is currently 
compatible with [official specification (v1)](http://www.libelium.com/development/smart-parking/documentation/smart-parking-technical-guide-v1/). Note that there is also a new 
version of the sensor available and we are already working on the implementation 
of the new version.

Feel free to [contact us](/contact/) if you are interested in integrating the 
Libelium Smart Parking (v1) sensor in your IoT platform.
